1) remove quotation marks from dataset by opening all the csv files with notepad++, then press ctrl+H, replaceall in all documents (make sure no other documents are open at that time!) " and ; by empty string
2) remove beforeunload identifiers
2a) removed wrong semicolons ':' (semicolons that started at the front of the time)
3) count the occurrences of main domains (for each load identifier) -> determine whether a Markov Model would be appropriate (sparse matrix or not?)
4*) determine training/test split (use k-folds from scikit on one hand; use manual splitting on the other hand)
    For the manual splitting, try 50/50; 60/40; 80/20 for training/test split
	pros/cons of k-fold vs manually: random distribution, so no bias. But as a user we know what to look for, so we can better adjust the training dataset to our needs. However, this is labor intensive and biased.
5*) apply Markov Models with different thresholds (< 10; < 20)
6*) after results are obtained, try to come up with a good explanation with the clicks (how did users get to this page?)




NOTES:

-don't add user id since we are learning over the entire dataset. Generalize
  -> we may reason that when applied to a particular user, that it's only personalized to the user since only the user's history is used to learn. (but this may be what we want!)
-pauses of 10 mins or longer counts as a new session: we reasoned that the users were conscious about generating clicks, so a break of 10 minutes or longer is rare.
-use info from the web navigation literature!!  user id, session id, ...:
   - first perform data cleaning (remove useless information)
   - identify users (already done for us, since the number of the csv files indicates the user id -> might have to add to the array)
   - identify sessions (using 'timeout': once the period between two clicks reaches a certain threshold, then a new session starts)
   - create data model

- possible to test different things:
    - entire dataset vs per user
    - training/test splits (see above)
    - markov model / other technique
