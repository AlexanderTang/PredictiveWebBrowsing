\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

We apply the Markov chain model with hill climbing search to predict the endpath of any domain. To prepare for this, the data must be transformed and reduced to a usable format. The model should also be tried and tested to find optimal parameters for real use. We provide an answer to the following research questions in this report:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which data representation was chosen?
	\item Which machine learning model did we use? What are our optimal parameter settings?
	\item How do we split the training and test data?
	\item What is the computational and memory cost of preprocessing, learning and evaluating?
\end{itemize}
Our implementation is done in Python 2.7, though we also run Python 3.5 to run the \textit{urlStreamHandler.pyw}.
